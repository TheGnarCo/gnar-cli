# Gnar CLI

The fastest way to get Gnar Approved&trade; configurations into your
application.

# Developing

Gnar-CLI is powered by [TypeScript] which means the project has to be compiled
before being run. 

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
1. Run `yarn start` to start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode.
1. Run `node dist/index.js` to run the 'compiled' application
